Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) R Practice

There are several advanced statistical methods or machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets. However, the most important step is the exploratory data analysis where data is looked at from different angles using simple statistical methods and visualizations, as well as cleaned, to highlight the important aspects of the data. This code repository is a compilation of various R code snippets for different aspects of EDA such as data cleaning, missing data handling, data structures, data visualization, cluster analysis etc, that are used to evaluate the structure and integrity of the available data.

The repository consists of ten files.
